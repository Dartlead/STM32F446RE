USART

Note: Currently, if hardware flow control is desired, both RTS and CTS must be used. There is no support for just
		one.

USART Pin Configurations Explained
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each USART channel has multiple sets of pins that it can use for its TX, RX, CTS, or RTS signals. The breakdown of
which channel can use what pins and the associated pin configuration number is described below.

USART1
Pin Config 1 | Pin Config 2 | Pin Config 3
TX  - PA9    | TX  - PB6    | TX  - N/A
RX  - PA10   | RX  - PB7    | RX  - N/A
CTS - PA11   | CTS - N/A    | CTS - N/A
RTS - PA12   | RTS - N/A    | RTS - N/A

USART2
Pin Config 1 | Pin Config 2 | Pin Config 3
TX  - PA2    | TX  - PD5    | TX  - N/A
RX  - PA3    | RX  - PD6    | RX  - N/A
CTS - PA0    | CTS - PD3    | CTS - N/A
RTS - PA1    | RTS - PD4    | RTS - N/A

USART3
Pin Config 1 | Pin Config 2 | Pin Config 3
TX  - PB10   | TX  - PC10   | TX  - PD8
RX  - PB11   | RX  - PC5    | RX  - PD9
CTS - PB13   | CTS - PD11   | CTS - N/A
RTS - PB14   | RTS - PD12   | RTS - N/A

UART4
Pin Config 1 | Pin Config 2 | Pin Config 3
TX  - PA0    | TX  - PC10   | TX  - N/A
RX  - PA1    | RX  - PC11   | RX  - N/A
CTS - PB0    | CTS - N/A    | CTS - N/A
RTS - PA15   | RTS - N/A    | RTS - N/A

UART5
Pin Config 1 | Pin Config 2 | Pin Config 3
TX  - PC12   | TX  - PE7    | TX  - N/A
RX  - PD2    | RX  - PE8    | RX  - N/A
CTS - PC9    | CTS - N/A    | CTS - N/A
RTS - PC8    | RTS - N/A    | RTS - N/A

USART6
Pin Config 1 | Pin Config 2 | Pin Config 3
TX  - PC6    | TX  - PG14   | TX  - N/A
RX  - PC7    | RX  - PG9    | RX  - N/A
CTS - PG13   | CTS - PG15   | CTS - N/A
RTS - PG8    | RTS - PG12   | RTS - N/A

Note that USART3 TX can also be routed to PC11 but there is no "matching" RX configuration so it is purposely left
out.

USART Channel Configuration Parameters Explained
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IrDA_mode_en (serial infrared data association encoder decoder mode enable)
	The Serial IrDA (infrared data association) encoder decoder...

	Restrictions:
		- If this value is 'true', the @oversample_mode must be 'USART_oversample_16'.

smartcard_mode_en (smartcard mode enable)

	Restrictions:
		- If this value is 'true', the @oversample_mode must be 'USART_oversample_16'.

LIN_mode_en (local interconnection network mode enable)

	Restrictions:
		- If this value is 'true', the @oversample_mode must be 'USART_oversample_16'.

hw_flow_cntrl_en (hard flow control enable)
	Hardware flow control introduces the RTS (request to send) and CTS (clear to send) signals that control the
	serial data flow between 2 devices connected via the USART channel.
	If 'true', enables hardware flow control.
	If 'false, disables hardware flow control.

oversample_mode (oversampling mode)
	The oversampling rate of the USART channel receiver used for data recovery by discriminating between valid
	incoming data and noise. Can either be 'USART_oversample_8' which oversamples by 8x the @baud_rate, or
	'USART_oversample_16' which oversamples by 16x the @baud_rate. Oversampling by 8 is used to achieve higher
	speed bu with reduced receiver tolerance to clock deviation. Oversampling by 16 is used to increase the receiver
	tolerance to clock deviations at th ecost of reduced maximum speed. Default is 16x.

	Restrictions:
		- If this value is 'USART_oversample_8', the @IrDA_mode_en must be 'false'.
		- If this value is 'USART_oversample_8', the @smartcard_mode_en must be 'false'.
		- If this value is 'USART_oversample_8', the @LIN_mode_en must be 'false'.

pin_TX_RX (TX and RX pin configurations)
	Each USART channel can have multiple pins that can be used as TX or RX. This option configures which set of
	available TX/RX pins shall be used for the channel. The full breakdown is seen in the "USART Pin Configuration
	Explained" section earlier in this document.

	Restrictions:
		- Only if the USART channel 3 is being configured is a 'USART_pin_cnfg3' value allowed for this option. All
			other USART channels can only use 'USART_pin_cnfg1' and 'USART_pin_cnfg2'.

pin_CTS_RTS (CTS and RTS pin configurations)
	Some of the USART channels can have multiple pins that can be used as CTS or RTS. This option configures which
	set of available CTS/RTS pins shall be used for the channel. The full breakdown is seen in the "USART Pin
	Configuration Explained" section earlier in this document.

	Restrictions:
		- 'USART_pin_cnfg2' is only available for USART channels 2, 3, and 6.
		- 'USART_pin_cnfg3' is not available for any USART channels.

num_stop_bits (number of stop bits)
	The number of stop bits transmitted with every character. The possible values are limited to 'USART_1_stop' (1
	stop bit), 'USART_2_stop' (2 stop bits), 'UASRT_0_5_stop' (0.5 stop bits, used when receiving data in smartcard
	mode), and 'USART_1_5_stop' (1.5 stop bits, used when transmitting and receiving data in smartcard mode).

	Restrictions:
		- Only if @smartcard_mode_en is 'true', can this value be either 'USART_0_5_stop' or 'USART_1_5_stop'.
		- 'USART_0_5_stop' or 'USART_1_5_stop' cannot be used if the USART channel being configured is UART4 or 5.

parity (parity control)
	The presence of a parity bit at the end of the frame (before the stop bit) that will be a '0' or '1' depending
	on the type of parity desired (odd or even) and the number of '1's and '0's in the data. If no parity control
	is desired, this value should be set to 'USART_parity_none', else 'USART_parity_even' for even parity or
	'USART_parity_odd' for odd parity.

word_length (word length)
	The number of bits that form the data frame of the transmitted frame.

	Restrictions:
		- This value must be either 8 or 9.

baud_rate (baud rate)
